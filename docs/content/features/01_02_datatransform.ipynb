    "As we are trying to assess the representativeness of the number of guests before and after the *break-point*, thereby assess whether there is a **structural-change** in our hotel bookings system, we need to model using proportions, `proportion_guests`. This is because we expect the number of guests to change after the potential **structural-change**, but if we can assess whether the proportions are the same or even similar, then we can still make inferences from our data before and after the change. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is because the similar proportions will suggest that whilst the absolute number of guests making hotel bookings have changed, the proportion of people from each group, `region`, are similar, so our data after the *break-point* is still representative of the old data before the *break-point*, and henceforth, any inferences still hold for the same population.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can think of this in the sense that before the *break-point*, we had our target **population** being captured in our data. If the proportions/compositions of people from each `region` are similar after the *break-point*, then we have a **representative sample** of our **target population**.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, we cannot model on proportion/compositional data because compositional data is bounded in the region $[0,1]$. There is a risk here that applying a model to it can give values outside this region, and henceforth be entirely meaningless because you cannot interpret such a value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, we can transform our compositional data by mapping our data into the real number space, $\\mathbb{R}%$. There are three well-characterised isomorphisms that do this:\n",

    "\n",
    "Alternatively, we can apply the following by adding a very small value to $0$ values for our proportions. In particular, it is also a common transformation to transform data to be approximately **normally-distributed**. \n",

    "In all these transformations, it is essential that our data does not contain any zeroes in. Thus we will use a multiplicative replacement strategy to replace zeroes with a small, positive $\\delta$, and do so in a way that ensures the compositions still add up to $1$.\n",
