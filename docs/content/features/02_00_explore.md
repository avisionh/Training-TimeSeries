# Exploratory Data Analysis

For this section, we will begin exploring our transformed dataset. The approach here is to get a feel for, understand and pick out key trends and points in our data, such as *outlier* observations which we would like to remove later when modelling our time-series data.

Moreover, we would like to find candidate *break-points* which we can test for a **structural break** at.

Thus, we want to do as the wise Bruce Lee suggests...
